2. run "npm install"

# Want something changed?

This repository is open to suggestions and discussion. If you want to modify, remove or add a rule make a pull request and add Valtteri Laine as reviewer.

# Overwriting rules

If you want to overwrite a rule you don't like in your project, just define the same rule in your projects own eslint configuration.
