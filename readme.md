# Why?

The purpose of this repository is to share eslint configs between Takam√§ki projects. This way we can write uniform code, and it also makes setting up rules for new projects faster.

# Installation

1. ```npm i @takamaki-group/eslint-config-takamaki --save-dev```
2. Install peer dependencies listed in package.json
3. Add ```"extends": ["@takamaki-group/eslint-config-takamaki"]``` to your .eslint config

# Overwriting rules

If you want to overwrite a rule you don't like in your project, just define the same rule in your projects own eslint configuration.

# Typescript

You should use ESlint with TypeScript as TSLint was deprecated in 2019. 

To use this config with Typescript add the following to your eslint config:

```
'extends': [
    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
],
```

Then install this package: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin
